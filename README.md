To create a system that calculates the API-Index from 1 to 5 based on the provided variables 
(Environment, Effectiveness of Elaboration, Types of Questions Asked, and Observations),
we need to define the weight and scale for each variable. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to building this system:

Define Weights for Each Variable:

Environment: 25%
Effectiveness of Elaboration: 25%
Types of Questions Asked: 25%
Observations: 25%
Scoring Criteria for Each Variable:

Environment: Score based on group size, goal clarity, and student demonstration of learning.
Effectiveness of Elaboration: Score based on relevance, level of detail, and student internalization.
Types of Questions Asked: Score based on how questions relate new material, use multiple representations, and justify problem-solving steps.
Observations: Score based on direct and indirect observations, including surveys, photo analysis, and performance assessments.
Normalization and Calculation:

Normalize each score to a scale of 1-5.
Calculate the weighted average to get the final API-Index.

You can adjust the scoring logic and weights as needed to better fit your specific criteria and data. 
This system provides a structured way to quantify and calculate the API-Index based on the defined variables.
